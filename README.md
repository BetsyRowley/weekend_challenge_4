# [Minnesota Listings](https://minnesota-listings.herokuapp.com/)

This weekend challenge put me in the role of an application developer for a real estate company that needed its collection of listings displayed.

We had to utilize client side logic to determine how to display different data sets (For Rent and For Sale) on the DOM. Create and Read of CRUD routes were explored.
