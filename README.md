# [Minnesota Listings](https://minnesota-listings.herokuapp.com/)

This weekend challenged uses the MEAN stack and the OMDB API to create an application that can search for movies. A user can also store their favorites in the database, as well as delete a stored favorite.

This challenge introduces AngularJS and the concept of using Controllers and Factories.

****UPDATE: OMDB API is no longer free so this application currently does connect to OMDB API.
